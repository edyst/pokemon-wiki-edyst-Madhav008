            Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and
            Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based
            on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so
            choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

         <h3> What Pokemon does Pikachu evolve into?</h3>

            <li>
              We're sure you know this Electric mouse Pokemon, and you know it
              quite well. Basic knowledge of Pikachu is essential for every
              trainer, but you should also be well versed in the rodent's
              evolutionary chain. Pikachu, mighty as it is, has an even stronger
              evolved form also capable of generating vast amounts of
              electricity. Maybe you've bumped into this species in the wild.
              Either way, this is a question all Pokemon trainers should be able
              to answer.
