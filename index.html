          <h1>Water</h1>
          <span>
            Water is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and
            Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Water is the most common type with over 100 Pokémon, which are based
            on a wide variety of fish and other sea-dwelling creatures.

          <span>
            Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and
            Grass, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players.
            Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games so
            choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.

            Grass is one of the three basic elemental types along with Fire and
            Water, which constitute the three starter Pokémon. This creates a
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new
            players.Grass is one of the weakest types statistically, with 5
            defensive weaknesses and 7 types that are resistant to Grass moves.
